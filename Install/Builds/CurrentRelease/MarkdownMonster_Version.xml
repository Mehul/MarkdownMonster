This update also fixes various file opening issues when opening files from the command line using *markdownmonster [filename]* or simply *mm [filename]*. Password for blog access are now encrypted and you can search downloaded blog headers for specific entries. Command line operation has been improved and you can now use `mm readme.md` to open files more easily in Markdown Monster.
