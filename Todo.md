# Markdown Monster ToDo List

### Immediate

* Add cursor position to status bar
* Integrate non-SnagIt screen capture natively
* <s>Open from Html</s>

### Bugs
* <s>HTML Preview sometime collapses to 0 width and won't reopen (after non-md/html file opening)</s>
* <s>Fix **Path Name Too Long** errors when downloading or creating posts</s>
* <s>Default font size on scaled displays is way too small. Need a way to initially detect DPI setting</s>

### Consideration
* Check out ReverseMarkdown C# source - needs adjustments (lists, spacing)
* Support arbitrary MetaWeblog API attributes in MetaData
* Drag and Drop Web Images into the editor (Not possible due to IE Security?)
* Copy Image from Clipboard into editor and save to disk? (See above)
* Git Commit/Push Addin
* PngOut on Png Images captured with SnagIt or Inserted
* Page Templates (add-in?)
* Multiple configurations for blog posts (use post/blogid subitems?)
